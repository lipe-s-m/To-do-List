### It is a web application planned by me, where I create a list of tasks for better time management.


## Through redux, I implemented features such as:

* Create new to-do task;
* Edit and delete any task;
* View task list with all existing tasks;
* Filter by pending, completed or all tasks.
* Filter by task name;

## Technologies Used:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>React</td>
    <td>React-Redux</td>
    <td>React-Hook-Form</td>
    <td>React-Router-Dom</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>^18.3.1</td>
    <td>^9.1.2</td>
    <td>^7.52.1</td>
    <td>^6.25.1</td>
  </tr>
</table>
